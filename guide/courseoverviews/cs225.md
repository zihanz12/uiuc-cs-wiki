# CS225: Data Structures

***Semester Last Updated:*** Spring 2021

Syllabus: https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/sp2021/policy/syllabus/

## Instructor(s): 
Carl Evans, Brad Solomon

## Topics Covered:
**Languages used**: C++

CS225 covers the applications, runtime, and motivations for the following data strucutres:
* Linked lists
* Stacks/Queues
* Trees (Includes binary search trees and AVL trees)
* Disjoint sets
* Priority queues/Heaps
* Hash tables
* Graphs

Additioanlly, CS225 provides a basic overview of C++ (debugging, pointers, and memory management), graph traversals (BFS, DFS), minimum spanning tree algorithms (Kruskal's algorithm, Prim's algorithm), and shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's, Floyd-Warshall algorithm).

## Meeting Schedule: 
* 50 minute lectures three times a week.
* 2 hour lab once a week. 
  * Designed as a class-alloted time for you to do the weekly labs, which can be done in a group.

*NOTE: Lecture and lab attendance are both optional.*

## Assignment/Exam Overview:

* **Labs**: Coding assignments given once a week. Labs act both as a review of the material covered in lecture and as a way to make you implement the things learned in lecture.
These assignments are smaller in scope compared to the MPs.
* **MPs**: Coding assignments given every two weeks. Typically, MPs are divided into two distinct parts, with part 1 being due for extra credit after the first week of the MP and the entire MP (both part 1 and part 2) being due after the second week. These assignments are designed to give you experience working on assignments that are larger in scale than those introduced in CS124 and CS128 and show some really cool applications of the data structures you learn in lecture.
* **Exams**: 3 cumulative assessments that test your knowledge of the material covered in lecture. Exam 1 covers material introduced in the latter part of CS173
(specifically closed forms, graphs, and trees), and exams 2 and 3 cover material tested in the previous exam(s).
* **Final Project**: A large scale coding project given at the end of the semester designed to test your knowledge of the material in the last quarter of the class. You are required to translate some data set into a graph and use certain approved algorithms analyze the data in that graph.
* **Problem of the Day (POTD)**: Daily coding assignments given for extra extra credit that are posted on PrairieLearn. These assignments vary in length and may or may not be worth doing depending on how lengthy the current POTD is.

## Grading Scheme:
Sourced from [CS225's syllabus](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/sp2021/policy/syllabus/):

In addition to the above grading, the class uses the following extra credit scheme:
* **Lab attendance**: 40 points total, 2 points earned per lab attended
* **POTDs**: Capped at 40 points of extra credit.
* **MP early submissions**: If you submit part 1 of each MP early you are given up to 8 points of extra credit on each MP, adding up to a total of 40. Partialcredit is given as a percentage of your week 1 submission grade.

Extra credit is capped at a total of 100 points. If you earn more than 100 extra credit points, you will not receive credit for anything over the cap.

## Tips for Success:
**Do the extra credit:** CS225 gives an incredibly generous amount of extra credit, up to 10% of your total grade. The easiest way to ensure that you end with an A is to get to 100 extra credit points. Assuming that you start the assignments at a reasonable time and do the extra credit, CS225 will be one of the easier A's that you can get.

**Start MPs early:** This especially applies to CS225. Office hours get notoriously crowded as the deadline for the MP approaches, so if you are stuck on a particular MP or lab you will not be able to get the help that you need. Doing the MPs early will let you figure out what parts you could struggle on and get you access to office hours when you need them.

## Additional Notes:
* CS296 is offered as a 1 credit hour honors complement to CS225 and covers different topics depending on which instructors are teaching it. Brad Solomon teaches CS296: String Algorithms and Data Structures and Mattox Beckman teaches CS296: Functional Data Structures.
