# Section 2 - Registration

See [The Office of the Registrar's Website](https://registrar.illinois.edu/registration/) for general resources on how registration works.

## 2.1 - Registration for CS/CS+X majors:
The best resource for figuring out how registration for CS majors works is [here](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/registration/cs-course-restrictions-enrollment-caps). To boil it down:

* Registration for all CS classes past CS225 is done in a staggered fashion based on year of enrollment, meaning that the classes slowly become available to more people as registration moves on. This also means that priority is determined by when you were actually admitted, not your class standing by credit hours. In terms of priority, freshmen < sophomores < juniors < seniors.
* Seats are reserved specfically for transfers and graduate students. If you are a transfer, don't worry about staggered enrollment, you will have a spot in the classes you need to graduate.
* For CS4-- electives, CSENG juniors and seniors receieve priority over Math+CS, Stats+CS, and CS+X. Once juniors and seniors have registered, registration is opened to all remaining CS students. The reason why this is the case is because 400 level CS electives are a graduation requirement for CSENG majors, so they need to take these classes in order to graduate. In the vast majority of cases, even if you are non-CSENG, you should have no trouble registering for the classes you want to even with this rule in place.

## 2.2 - Registration for Non-majors:
For non-majors, CS courses can be broken into two categories:

#### Open Enrollment:
The classes that are open enrollment are as follows:
* CS124: Introduction to Computer Science I
* CS128: Introduction to Computer Science II
* CS173: Discrete Structures
* CS225: Data Structrues
* CS classes intended for non-majors (CS101, CS105, CS277, etc.)

Open enrollment means that CS majors are not given specific priority to take these classes, meaning that everyone registers for them at the same time. The earlier you register, the more easily you'll be able to take these classes. James Scholars/Chancellor's Scholars/ROTC members should have no issues getting these classes since they have the highest registration priorty out of all students.

#### Staggered Enrollment:

All classes not already listed above fall under staggered enrollment. The information in ยง2.1 explains how staggered registration works. If you don't care to that section it, just know that all CS majors will register before you do.

## 2.3 - Will I Get the CS Class I Want?

The answer to this question depends on your major:

#### CS/Stats+CS/Math+CS/CS+X:

Yes. Everybody in these majors should be able to register for whatever CS classes they want to without issue, schedule permitting. There are very few exceptions:
* You are a first time freshman trying to take 400 level electives. All freshmen are restrictred from registering from any 400 level CS electives to prevent freshmen who are way ahead of the game (i.e. have already received credit for CS225) to take up class spots that CSENG upperclassmen need fulfill their CS elective requirement.
* You are trying to take a very popular CS class as a lower division student. Classes like CS441: Applied Machine Learning and some of the CS498 electives are very popular and can fill up even by the time that you are able to register. This is not an issue if you are a junior/senior, since you pick CS classes before everyone else is able to.
* You missed your registration date. If you're registering much later than you should be, then you might be in trouble. Speak with your advisor to make sure that you can get into the classes that you need to take to graduate.

### PREP/Engineering Undeclared:
Yes. There are sections in these classes exclusively for PREP and Engineering Undeclared students, meaning that the department has already carved out some spots for you so that you can get the classes you need to transfer out.

### For Non-Majors:
The answer to this question is dependent on what classes you plan on registering for:
* CS101/105: Yes. If you plan on taking these, it's probably because they are required for your major, meaning you should have no issues registering.
* CS125: Most likely, yes. This is an intro class created specifically for freshmen, meaning that unless you get incredibly unlucky and the class is filled by the time you register, you'll be able to take this class.
* CS173/CS225: Depends on your registration priority. These classes tend to fill up very quickly because they are in high demand (specifically CS225, which is the de facto software internship class), meaning that the earlier you can register the more easily you will be able to claim a spot.
* CS233/CS241/CS421: Somewhat difficult to register for. These are all staggered registration classes that most CS majors are required to take.
* CS374: Hard to register for. In addition to being a grad requirement for all CS and Computer Engineering majors, this class is very popular among people not in the aforementioned categories.
* CS4-- electives: Depends entirely on which elective you take. CS majors get spots for these before everyone else, meaning that non-majors may or may not have a hard time registering for these depending on how popular the course is among CS students. That said, some elective courses are not in very high demand, so you are best able to get a spot in one of these.
* Crosslisted CS4-- Electives (e.g. CS413/MATH413): No. All crosslisted 400 level electives are restricted specifically to majors within the departments the class is crosslisted under.
