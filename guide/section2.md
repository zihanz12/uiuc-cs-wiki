# Section 2 - Registration

See [The Office of the Registrar's website](https://registrar.illinois.edu/registration/) for general resources on how registration works.

## 2.0.1 - Prerequisite Enforcement:

The CS department is the only department at UIUC that forces students to complete prerequisites for core (required) classes. For all other departments, students are not required to explicitly have credit for or be currently enrolled in prerequisite classes in order to register for whichever class requires said prerequisites. In a sense, the CS department turns de facto recommendations into hard restrictions.

However, by university policy, the CS department is not allowed to enforce prerequisites for any 400 level elective courses, and students are able to register for whichever 400 level courses they would like to without having prerequisite credit.

## 2.1 - Staggered Registration:
In order to accomodate the sheer size of the CS department and the popularity of classes it offers, certain registration restrictions are placed on its classes in order to make sure that students who are CS majors are able to register for the classes they need. The best resource for figuring out how registration for CS majors works is [here](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/registration/cs-course-restrictions-enrollment-caps). To boil it down:

* All classes that are marked as staggered registration (ST) are gradually opened up to CS students on the basis of seniority. Juniors and seniors register first, then sophomores, then freshmen. The time that you register for CS classes is determined by your cohort (the year you enrolled at UIUC), not your class standing by credit hours.
* CSENG juniors and seniors are given slight priority over Math+CS, Stats+CS, and CS+X juniors and seniors for registering for 400 level electives. This is likely a consequence of the fact that CSENG is required to take CS electives to graduate.
* Cohort restrictions are lifted one by one on different dates. Once a cohort restriction is lifted, all students in that cohort are able to register for their classes.
* Once all cohort restrictions have been lifted, classes will open for non-majors. Students in the Grainger College of Engineering register first, and then classes are opened to the entire university.

NOTE: Staggered registration applies ONLY to CS classes. Your time of registration for classes not under the CS department is determined by your general registration time ticket.

## 2.2 - Open Registration:
Classes that do not fall under staggered registration are considered open registration.

The classes that are open enrollment are as follows:
* CS124: Introduction to Computer Science I
* CS128: Introduction to Computer Science II
* CS173: Discrete Structures
* CS225: Data Structrues
* CS classes intended for non-majors (CS101, CS105, CS277, etc.)

A class is open registration if CS majors are not given specific registration priority for them. This means that registration is not restricted or timegated by major, and when you are able to register for these classes is determined by when your general time ticket for registration is.

## 2.3 - Will I Get the CS Class I Want?

**The answer to this question depends on your major:**

### CS/Stats+CS/Math+CS/CS+X:

**Yes.** Everybody in these majors should be able to register for whatever CS classes they want to, assuming a class does not cause a schedule conflict. There are a few exceptions:
* **You are a first time freshman trying to take 400 level electives:** All freshmen are restrictred from registering for any 400 level CS electives to prevent freshmen who are way ahead of the game (i.e. have already received credit for CS225) to take up class spots that CSENG upperclassmen need fulfill their CS elective requirement.
* **You are trying to take a popular CS elective as a lower division student:** Classes like CS441: Applied Machine Learning and some of the CS498 electives are very popular and can fill up even by the time that you are able to register. This is not an issue if you are a junior/senior, since you pick CS classes before everyone else is able to.
* **You missed your registration date:** If you're registering much later than you should be, you might be in trouble. Speak with your advisor to make sure that you can get into the classes that you need to take to graduate on time.

### PREP/Engineering Undeclared:
**Yes.** There are sections in CS classes created exclusively for PREP and Engineering Undeclared students. The department is required to specifically carve out spots for these majors in order to make sure that students are getting the classes they need for transferring.

### Non-Majors:
The answer to this question is dependent on what classes you plan on registering for:
* **CS101/105:** Yes. If you plan on taking these, it's probably because they are required for your major, meaning you should have no issues registering.
* **CS124:** Most likely, yes. This is an intro class with a lot of spots that some CS majors will end up skipping entirely.
* **CS173/CS225:** Dependent on your registration time ticket. These classes tend to fill up quickly because they are in high demand (especially CS225), meaning that the earlier you can register the more easily you will be able to claim a spot.
* **CS233/CS241/CS421:** Arguably somewhat difficult but not impossible to register for. These are all staggered registration classes that most CS majors are required to take.
* **CS374:** Difficult to register for. In addition to being a grad requirement for all CS and Computer Engineering majors, this class is popular among students not in the aforementioned categories.
* **CS4-- electives:** Depends entirely on which elective you take. CS majors get spots for these before everyone else, meaning that non-majors may or may not have a hard time registering for these depending on how popular the course is among CS students. That said, some elective courses are not in very high demand, so you are best able to get a spot in one of these.
* **Crosslisted CS4-- Electives** (e.g. CS413/MATH413): If you are not in either of the crosslisted departments, no. All crosslisted 400 level electives are restricted specifically to students within the departments the class is crosslisted under.
