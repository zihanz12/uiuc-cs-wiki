# Addendum A: Why Does this Exist?

There are several issues with the current state of information in the CS department:

1. **Department-specific information is too decentralized.** Information on a variety of different topics is found in a bunch of different places on a bunch of different websites, and is often difficult to find or access. Having all of this information packed into one repository is notably more helpful.
2. **Current wiki pages are either outdated or not CS-specific.** As an example, Dr. Everitt's Neighborhood is a good example of what a department specific wiki could look like, but it mostly features information related to the ECE department.
3. **Information is not openly accessible.** Some valuable pieces of information are locked behind university-specific websites that non-students cannot access. This is particularly an issue when it comes to providing information to prospective students.
4. **Not everything is accessible online.** There are some pieces of information that can't be found even with a Google search. This guide aims to change that.

Ultimately, the end goal of this project is to be the official source for department-internal info, and to accomplish this the maintainers of this repository will work  with fellow CS students, advising, and faculty.
