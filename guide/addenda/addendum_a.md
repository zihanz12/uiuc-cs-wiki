# Addendum A: Why Does this Exist?

There are several issues with the current state of information in the CS department:
1. **Department-specific information is too decentralized.** Information on a variety of different topics is found in a bunch of different places on a bunch of differnt websites. This is not ipso facto a bad thing, but having all of this information packed into one site
2. **Current wiki pages are either outdated or not CS-specific.** As an example, [Dr. Everitt's Neighborhood](https://wiki.illinois.edu//wiki/display/HKNDEN/Home) is a good start for repository of CS-related information, but features outdated or ECE-specific information and is tucked away in the corners of the UIUC wiki.
3. **Information is not openly accessible.** Some valuable pieces of information are locked behind university-specific websites that non-students cannot access. This is particularly an issue when it comes to providing information for prospective students.
4. **Not everything is accessible online.** There are some pieces of information that can't be found even with a Google search. This guide aims to remedy that.

The goal of this repository is to remedy these issues by providing a centralized, accurate source of department-specific information that is helpful to all students, regardless of major, year, or affiliation with UIUC.
