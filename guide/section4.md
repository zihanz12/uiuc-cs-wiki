# Section 4 - Transferring to CS

## 4.1 - Some Warnings:

I've you have done any amount of looking online about transferring to CS @ UIUC, you'll likely have noticed that Reddit and Quora are [rife](https://www.quora.com/How-difficult-is-it-to-switch-to-the-CS-major-at-UIUC) [with](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/a6gpfi/note_to_class_of_2023_trying_to_transfer_into/) [warnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/780h7a/question_how_hard_is_transferring_from_undeclared/) [about](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/agibe5/how_hard_is_it_to_transfer_into_computer_science/) [the horrors](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/3b971x/transfer_to_computer_science/) [of transferring](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/g87sr2/help_now_got_ae_at_uiuc_want_to_transfer_into/). 
In short, the commentary provided in these threads is mostly correct. Prospective students should ***NOT*** under any circumstances attend UIUC because they want to transfer to CS, regardless of if they were placed in PREP, Engineering Undeclared, or a different major. This applies to every major, even majors that are deemed as CS-adjacent. In general, the process of transferring is too arduous, long, and anxiety-inducing for the vast majority of students to warrant attempting to transfer. However, this does not mean that no student should ever attempt to transfer, and indeed there are some students that are very successful in transferring. 

The reason why incoming students are polemically discouraged from attempting to transfer is not because the CS curriculum is especially difficult or daunting or that students want to gatekeep CS, but rather because UIUC places a lot of very arbitrary hurdles in front of students in order to discourage them from transferring. These hurdles will be explained in the sections below.

If you would like to transfer, you should:
* Be happy with your present major or have another major you would like to pick up that you can easily transfer to.
* Have a well-thought-out backup plan for if you are unsuccessful in transferring.
* Have a good understanding of computer science as a field.
* Have prior experience and success taking technical courses at a college level.
