# Section 4 - Frequently Asked Questions

## 4.1 - Should I Take X with Y?

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** All of these recommendations are based off of general consensus. Your ability to combine certain classes is ultimately determined by your own limits, strengths, and weaknesses as a student. The recommendations provided below should not be taken as gospel.

### CS128 + CS173: 
Yes. The CS curriculum's [curriculum map](https://grainger.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/majors-and-minors/cs-map) explicitly lists CS128 and CS173 as being taken together, and if you are a CS major you will need to take these courses concurrently to graduate on time.

### CS225 + CS233:
Doable, but not universally advisable. CS225 and CS233 are particularly difficult, but they do have a large amount of work associated with them. This means that if you are not careful and overburden yourself with difficult or high-workload classes, it may too much work to be worth it.

### CS233 + CS374:
Generally considered to be not advisable. While CS233 is not the most difficult of courses in the core curriculum, combining CS233 and CS374 may end up being more trouble than it is worth due to the very high workload of CS374, which can be very time-demanding for many students. In the event that you are insistent on taking these at the same time, you ought to tailor your schedule to include classes that have a low amount of work.

### CS241 + CS374: 
This is by far the least advisable of all of the combinations listed. Via Wade-Fagen Ulmschneider's [average GPA by course](https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/gpa_of_every_course_at_illinois/) webpage, CS241 and CS374 have by far the lowest GPAs of any course in the core CS curriculum. Generally speaking, both courses are considered to have some of the highest workloads of any courses offered, and it is almost polemically recommended by both students and advisors that these classes should NOT be taken together.

## 4.2 - What's the Difference Between X and Y?

### CS101 vs. CS105 vs. CS124:

On face, CS101 and CS105 are NOT intended for students who want to take additional CS classes, as they will not provide you with a good enough background to understand material in later CS classes. CS101 is intended for technical majors that require basic programming knowledge, and CS105 is intended for non-technical majors that require some basic understanding of computer systems and of certain software packages.

In contrast, CS124 is comprehensive introductory programming course designed for incoming CS majors. Students who wish to pursue a CS minor or explore CS related classes should always take CS124 instead of CS101 and CS105.

### CS173 vs. MATH213 vs. MATH347:

CS173 and MATH213 have a very large amount of content overlap, although CS173 is generally considered to be a better and more uniformly run class than MATH213. With respect to the CS curriculum, MATH213 is primarily taken by non-majors who aren't able to take CS173 in order to meet the prerequisites to take CS225. CS majors are not allowed to replace CS173 with MATH347 or MATH213, both because the department will not accept replacement credit and because CS374 (a required course) explcitly requires CS173.

MATH347 is taken by Math and Math & CS majors as a degree requirement. The class is more intended as a rigorous introduction to college mathematics rather than something strictly CS oriented, although there is a large enough content overlap to the extent that some who take MATH347 choose to test out of CS173 to avoid redundancy. Students wishing to take up a Math double major or minor should take MATH347 regardless of whether or not they've taken CS173.

### CS225 vs. CS277:

While CS277 is being offered for the first time next semester, the intent of the class is intended to be a data science and non-major oriented course that covers some of the same material that CS225 covers but builds on it in the context of [STAT107](https://stat107.hknguyen.org/) and [STAT207](http://courses.las.illinois.edu/spring2020/stat207/syllabus/). CS277 should be taken by non-majors who have interests in data science and have taken or want to take STAT107 and STAT207.

CS277 should NOT be taken by CS majors, CS minors, or those who intend to take additional CS courses explicitly requiring CS225. CS225 will provide a wider and more rigorous overview of data structures because it builds on the material of previous CS courses rather than STAT107 and STAT207.

### CS233 + CS241 vs. CS240:

On its face, CS240 is designed to be a substitute for 233/241 that condenses the material in both classes. CS240 was created for certain CS+X majors which the department believes do not require as extensive of an overview of computer systems. If you have any interest in either computer architecture or systems, it is recommended to take both CS233 and CS241 instead. Note that CS240 acts as a replacement for CS233 and CS241 exclusively for certain CS+X majors, and if your degree requirements do not explcitly specify CS240 as an option, you are required to take CS233 and CS241.

CS240 provides a helpful [topic comparison chart](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs240/fa2020/static/lectures/cs240-topics.pdf) showing the pure content differences between the class and 233/241 based on what it covers in lecture. Notably, CS240 covers databases, containerization, and APIs, where CS233 and CS241 do not.

### CS357 + CS457 vs. CS450:

### CS361 vs. STAT400 vs. MATH461:

### CS440 vs. CS441 vs. CS446:

### CS447 vs. LING406:

LING406 is intended for CS+Linguistics students or students who have a good understanding of the linguistic theory associated with computational linguistics. CS447 by contrast does not require understanding of basic linguistics concepts, and introduces all of the concepts in class.

### CS483/ECE408 vs. CS484:

## 4.3 - What's the Difference Between CS, Math & CS/Statistics & CS, and CS+X?

There are several concrete differences between CS+X and CSENG:
* All students in +X programs have access to advising and resources both from the Grainger College of Engineering and the college that their +X is administrated under. CSENG students are
* Barring the notable exceptions of Math+CS, Statistics+CS and CS+Astrophysics, CS+X degrees place less emphasis on math and science degree requirements. This does not imply that students in CS+X degree programs do not take advanced or foundational math and science courses, but rather that certain classes in these categories are not required to graduate.
* +X degrees integrate interdisciplinary coursework as part of degree requirements.
* Students who are not strictly CSENG majors cannot apply for the CS department's 5 year BS/MCS program.

Math & CS/Statistics & CS and CS+X are not:
* Dual degree programs. The requirements of CS+X are similar but not identical to the "pure" CS and +X parts it is composed of. This is by design, as there are some elements of the respective degree parts were deemed either superfluous, unecessary, or overly onerous for the purposes of an undergraduate degree.
* Separate LAS degree programs. All students in these majors take the exact same CS classes as those in CSENG.
* Objectively superior or inferior degrees. These degrees are ultimately tailored to fit a wide range of different student interests and backgrounds, and cannot be judged as better or worse than a CSENG degree. As a general rule of thumb, success in the field of CS is more determined by individual student effort and ability rather than degree title.
