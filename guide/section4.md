# Section 4 - Frequently Asked Questions

## 4.1 - Should I Take X with Y?

### CS128 + CS173: 
Yes. The CS curriculum's [curriculum map](https://grainger.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/majors-and-minors/cs-map) explicitly lists CS128 and CS173 as being taken together, and in order to graduate on time you will need to take these courses concurrently.

### CS225 + CS233:
The viability of this combination is ultimately dependent on your own limits as a student and the constraints imposed by the other classes you're taking. CS225 and CS233 are not the most difficult of classes, however they do have a large amount of work associated with them, meaning that if you are not careful and overburden yourself with difficult or high-workload classes, it may be 

### CS233 + CS374:
Generally considered to be not advisable. While CS233 is not the most difficult of courses in the core curriculum, combining CS233 and CS374 may end up being more trouble than it is worth due to the very high workload of CS374, which can be very time-demanding for many students. In the event that you are insistent on taking these at the same time, you ought to tailor your schedule to include classes that have a low amount of work.

### CS241 + CS374: 
This is by far the least advisable of all of the combinations listed. Via Wade-Fagen Ulmschneider's [average GPA by course](https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/gpa_of_every_course_at_illinois/) webpage, CS241 and CS374 have by far the lowest GPAs of any course in the core CS curriculum. Generally speaking, both courses are considered to have some of the highest workloads of any courses offered, and it is almost polemically recommended by both students and advisors that these classes should NOT be taken together.
