# Section 4 - Frequently Asked Questions

## 4.1 - Should I Take X with Y?

### CS128 + CS173: 
Yes. The CS curriculum's [curriculum map](https://grainger.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/majors-and-minors/cs-map) explicitly lists CS128 and CS173 as being taken together, and in order to graduate on time you will need to take these courses concurrently.

### CS225 + CS233:
The viability of this combination is ultimately dependent on your own limits as a student and the constraints imposed by the other classes you're taking. CS225 and CS233 are not the most difficult of classes, however they do have a large amount of work associated with them, meaning that if you are not careful and overburden yourself with difficult or high-workload classes, it may too much work to be worth it.

### CS233 + CS374:
Generally considered to be not advisable. While CS233 is not the most difficult of courses in the core curriculum, combining CS233 and CS374 may end up being more trouble than it is worth due to the very high workload of CS374, which can be very time-demanding for many students. In the event that you are insistent on taking these at the same time, you ought to tailor your schedule to include classes that have a low amount of work.

### CS241 + CS374: 
This is by far the least advisable of all of the combinations listed. Via Wade-Fagen Ulmschneider's [average GPA by course](https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/gpa_of_every_course_at_illinois/) webpage, CS241 and CS374 have by far the lowest GPAs of any course in the core CS curriculum. Generally speaking, both courses are considered to have some of the highest workloads of any courses offered, and it is almost polemically recommended by both students and advisors that these classes should NOT be taken together.

## 4.2 - What's the Difference Between X and Y?

### CS101 vs. CS105 vs. CS124:
CS101 and CS105 are NOT intended for students who want to take additional CS classes, as they will not provide you with a good enough background to understand higher level material. CS101 and CS105 exist for non-CS majors that require some amount of programming or software knowledge. However, CS124 is comprehensive introductory course designed for incoming CS majors. Students who wish to pursue a CS minor or explore CS related classes should always take CS124 instead of CS101 and CS105.

### CS173 vs. MATH213 vs. MATH347:

With respect to the CS curriculum, MATH213 is primarily taken by ECE majors in order to meet the prerequisites to take CS225. CS majors are not allowed to replace CS173 with MATH347 or MATH213, both because the department will not accept replacement credit and because CS374 (a required class to graduate) specifically requires CS173. MATH347 is taken by Math and Math & CS majors as a degree requirement.

### CS225 vs. CS277:

### CS233 + CS241 vs. CS240:

CS240 provides a helpful [topic comparison chart](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs240/fa2020/static/lectures/cs240-topics.pdf) showing the pure content differences between itself and 233/241 based on what it covers in lecture. On its face, CS240 is designed to be a substitute for 233/241 that condenses the material in both classes. CS240 was created for certain CS+X majors which the department believe did not a require an incredibly thorough overview of computer systems. If you have any interest in either computer architecture or systems, it is generally recommended that you take both CS233 and CS241 instead of CS240, but if you are not required and you don't care to take both then it's perfectly fine to take CS240.

### CS222 vs. CS242:

### CS361 vs. STAT400 vs. MATH461:

### CS440 vs. CS441 vs. CS446:

### CS447 vs. LING406:
