# Section 0: Incoming CS Majors

## 0.1 Preparing for Your First Semester

The best way to academically prepare is to celebrate your acceptance by getting a much needed break and enjoying your final moments as a high school student by spending time with friends and family. Unless you're planning on taking a proficiency exam to place out of a class, you do not need to do anything to prepare yourself for the CS curriculum at UIUC. That said, if you think you're rusty and want to practice coding before you start in class, [leetcode](leetcode.com) and [hackerrank](hackerrank.com) are both great resources to brush up on your programming skills.

## 0.2 Proficiency Exams

Typically, some incoming or already enrolled students will already the material covered in the curriculum's introductory courses. To allow students to skip potentially unnecessary or redundant classes, the university offers proficiency exams which allow students to completely skip a class should they pass the exam. Students will not recieve a letter grade for skipping out of a class, although they will recieve a PS on their transcript noting that they passed the proficiency exam.

Information on proficiency exams (practice, proctoring, scheduling, minimum passing grades) can be found [here](https://proficiency.cs.illinois.edu/).

Three different core classes offer proficiency exams:

**CS124:** This exam is by far the most popular proficiency exam, and many students with varying levels of programming experience take and pass the exam. Students who take this exam typically have taken AP Computer Science A (or have an equivalent level of programming experience) and are motivated to learn additional topics. This exam covers fundamental programming skills and object-oriented design patterns.

**CS173:** This exam is typically taken by students who have taken a discrete math course in high school or Math+CS/Stats+CS majors who have credit for Calculus 1, 2, and 3 and do not want to take both MATH347 and CS173. This exam covers topics like sets, formal logic, graphs/trees, functions, relations, basic number theory, induction, and more.

**CS225:** This exam is targeted towards students who typically have a heavy computer science background and have knowledge of a multitude of different data structures. Covers binary search trees, stacks, queues, linked lists, graphs, disjoint sets, and more. Additionally covers graph algorithms such as breadth-first search, depth-first search, Dijkstra's/Prim's algorithm, and Kruskal's algorithm.

## 0.3 First-time Freshman Registration

First-time freshman registration occurs between June and July, and is done on a first-come-first-serve basis, meaning that those who sign up for registration first can choose earlier registration dates. Generally, it is advisable to get as early of a registration date as is possible. The earlier you are able to register the more flexibility you have for which classes you can take. Before signing up for registration, freshmen are required to complete a portion of the [admitted student checklist](https://myillini.illinois.edu/) and are required to schedule a meeting with their advisor a week before registration. More details can be found [here](https://admissions.illinois.edu/Apply/Admitted/summer-registration#sign-up).

Registration occurs before proficiency exams happen, and first-time freshmen are required to first register for classes as if they do not plan to take any proficiency exams. This means that if you are planning to place out of CS124, you are required to first register for CS124 and then register for the next classes in the sequence once you have passed the exam. This is to prevent students who do not end up passing the exam from taking class spots from those who have passed the exam or already have credit for the class.

### 0.4 What Classes Should I Take?

Which classes you should take is ultimately dependent on your individual graduation requirements, which classes you are coming in with credit for, and your overall goals for your undergraduate education. As a starting point, the CS department provides a helpful [flowchart](https://grainger.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/majors-and-minors/cs-map) which may be a good way for you to get an idea of what a four-year plan would look like. However, the majority of students do not take classes in the order that they are listed here, and you should consult with [your advisors](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/undergraduate-advising) to determine what works best for you.

## 0.5 - Transferring to CS:

If you've done any amount of looking online about transferring to CS @ UIUC, you'll likely have noticed that Reddit and Quora are [rife](https://www.quora.com/How-difficult-is-it-to-switch-to-the-CS-major-at-UIUC) [with](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/a6gpfi/note_to_class_of_2023_trying_to_transfer_into/) [warnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/780h7a/question_how_hard_is_transferring_from_undeclared/) [about](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/agibe5/how_hard_is_it_to_transfer_into_computer_science/) [the horrors](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/3b971x/transfer_to_computer_science/) [of transferring](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/g87sr2/help_now_got_ae_at_uiuc_want_to_transfer_into/). 
In short, the commentary provided in these threads is mostly correct. Prospective students should ***NOT*** attend UIUC because they want to transfer to CS, regardless of if they were placed in PREP, Engineering Undeclared, or a different major. This applies to every major, even majors that are deemed as CS-adjacent. In general, the process of transferring is too arduous and long for the majority of students to warrant attempting to transfer. However, this does not mean that no student should ever attempt to transfer, and indeed there are some students that are very successful in transferring.

The reason why incoming students are almost polemically discouraged from attempting to transfer is not because the CS curriculum is especially difficult or daunting or that students want to gatekeep CS, but rather because UIUC places a lot of very arbitrary hurdles in front of students in order to discourage them from transferring.

If you would like to transfer, you should:
* Be happy with your present major or have another major you would like to pick up that you can easily transfer to.
* Have a well-thought-out backup plan for if you are unsuccessful in transferring.
* Have a good understanding of computer science as a field.

If you would like to transfer at all, consult [this page](https://cs.illinois.edu/admissions/undergraduate/transfer-students) for more information on the requirements.
