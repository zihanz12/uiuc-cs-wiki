# Section 0: Incoming CS Majors

## 0.1 Preparing for Your First Semester

The best way to prepare is to celebrate your acceptance by getting a much needed break, and enjoying your final moments as a high school student by spending time with friends and family. Unless you're planning on taking a proficiency exam to place out of a class or you just really realy like academics (more power to you), you don't need to do anything to prepare yourself for the CS curriculum at UIUC. That said, if you think you're really rusty and want to practice coding before you start in class, [leetcode](leetcode.com) and [hackerrank](hackerrank.com) are both great resources to brush up on your programming skills.

## 0.2 Proficiency Exams

Typically, some incoming or already enrolled students will already the material covered in the curriculum's introductory courses. To allow students to skip potentially unnecessary or redundant classes, the university offers proficiency exams which allow students to completely skip a class should they pass the exam. Students will not recieve a letter grade for skipping out of a class, although they will recieve a PS on their transcript noting that they passed the proficiency exam.

Information on proficiency exams (practice, proctoring, scheduling, minimum passing grades) can be found [here](https://proficiency.cs.illinois.edu/).

Three different core classes offer proficiency exams:

**CS124:** This exam is by far the most popular proficiency exam, and many students with varying levels of programming experience take and pass the exam. Students who take this exam typically have taken AP Computer Science A (or have an equivalent level of programming experience) and are motivated to learn additional topics. This exam covers basic programming skills and object-oriented design patterns.

**CS173:** This exam is typically taken by students who have taken a discrete math course in high school or Math+CS/Stats+CS majors who have credit for Calculus 1, 2, and 3 and do not want to take both MATH347 and CS173. This exam covers topics like sets, formal logic, graphs/trees, functions, relations, basic number theory, induction, and more.

**CS225:** This exam is targeted towards students who already have a heavy programming background and have knowledge of a multitude of different data structures. Covers binary search trees, stacks, queues, linked lists, graphs, disjoint sets, and more. Additionally covers graph algorithms such as breadth-first search, depth-first search, Dijkstra's/Prim's algorithm, and Kruskal's algorithm.

## 0.3 First-time Freshman Registration

First-time freshman registration occurs between June and July, and is done on a first-come-first-serve basis, meaning that those who sign up for registration first can choose earlier registration dates. Generally, it is advisable to get as early of a registration date as is possible. The earlier you are able to register the more flexibility you have for which classes you can take. Before signing up for registration, freshmen are required to complete a portion of the [admitted student checklist](https://myillini.illinois.edu/) and are required to schedule a meeting with their advisor a week before registration. More details can be found [here](https://admissions.illinois.edu/Apply/Admitted/summer-registration#sign-up).

Registration occurs before proficiency exams happen, and first-time freshmen are required to first register for classes as if they do not plan to take any proficiency exams. This means that if you are planning to place out of CS124, you are required to first register for CS124 and then register for the next classes in the sequence once you have passed the exam. This is to prevent students who do not end up passing the exam from taking class spots from those who have passed the exam or already have credit for the class.
