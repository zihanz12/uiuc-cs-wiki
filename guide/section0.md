# Section 0: So I've Been Admitted. What Now?

## 0.1: Preparing for Your First Semester

The best way to prepare is to celebrate your acceptance by getting a much needed break, and enjoying your final moments as a high school student by spending time with friends and family. Unless you're planning on taking a proficiency exam to place out of a class or you just really realy like academics (more power to you), you don't need to do anything to prepare yourself for the CS curriculum at UIUC. That said, if you think you're really rusty and want to practice coding before you start in class, [leetcode](leetcode.com) and [hackerrank](hackerrank.com) are both great resources to brush up on your programming skills.

## 0.2 Proficiency Exams

Typically, a portion of incoming freshmen will already know all of or a large portion of the material for the CS curriculums introductory courses. To allow students that are coming in with more programming/math experience to skip unnecessary or redundant classes, the university offers proficiency exams which allow students to completely skip a class should they pass the exam. Students will not recieve a letter grade from skipping out of a class, although they will recieve a PS on their transcript noting that they passed the proficiency exam.

Information on proficiency exams (practice, proctoring, scheduling, minimum passing grades) can be found [here](https://proficiency.cs.illinois.edu/).

Three different proficiency exams are offered, and an overview of each is provided below:

### 0.2.1 - CS124 Proficiency Exam

This exam is by far the most popular proficiency exam, and many students with varying levels of programming experience take and pass the exam. Students who take this exam typically have taken AP Computer Science A (or have an equivalent level of programming experience) and are motivated to learn additional topics.

### 0.2.2 - CS173 Proficiency Exam

This exam is typically taken by students who have taken a discrete math course in high school or Math+CS/Stats+CS majors who have credit for Calculus 1, 2, and 3 and do not want to take both MATH347 and CS173. This exam covers topics like sets, formal logic, graphs/trees, functions, relations, basic number theory, induction, and more.

### 0.2.3 - CS225 Proficiency Exam

An even less common proficiency exam, this exam is targeted towards students who already have an incredibly heavy programming background and know the ins and outs of various data structures like BSTs, stacks, queues, linked lists, graphs, disjoint sets, and more.
