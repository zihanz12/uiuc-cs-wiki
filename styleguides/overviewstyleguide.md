# Course Overview Guidelines:

NOTE: See the [CS225 course overview](https://github.com/mersaults/uiuc-cs-wiki/blob/main/guide/courseoverviews/cs225.md) for reference. This overview is slightly redundant due to the fact that all of CS225's course information can be found on its syllabus, but is here more to act as a guide for writing an overview.

Any course overviews should adhere to the [general styleguide](https://github.com/mersaults/uiuc-cs-wiki/blob/main/styleguides/styleguide.md) and the following guidelines:

**Don't recite information that can be easily found by reading the syllabus.** This doesn't apply if there is no syllabus that can be found for the class. Distilling and shortening information provided in the syllabus is fine if it is too verbose or lengthy, but if the syllabus already has the relevant information either provide a screenshot of that part of the syllabus or omit the information entirely.

**Be specific about the class you are writing an overview for.** Writing general academic tips is nice, but isn't useful in the context of a specific class. Writing things like "go to office hours" or "study in advance for the exams" are only useful tips if they apply especially to the class you are writing about for certain reasons.

**Course overviews are probably not a place to rant about how difficult or awful a course was.** Not every course will be amazing, but the focus of your writing should be on providing constructive information that will help other people that take the class succeed.

All course overviews should have the following information:

* Semester Last Updated (when you took the course)

* Syllabus

* Instructors

* Topics Covered
  * This can just be a general list of all of the major topics in the course. A lot of detail isn't required, but avoid being so general as to just be rewording what's in the [course catalog](http://catalog.illinois.edu/courses-of-instruction/cs/).
  
* Meeting Schedule
  * Should include how many times the class meets per week and what types of meetings there are (lecture, lab, etc). Note if attendance for a certain meeting is optional or not.
  
* Assignment/Exam Overview
  * This should be a generalized overview of the types of assignments and exams given in the class. You don't have to go into detail as to what each individual exam or assignment covers.

* Grading Scheme
  * In some cases the grading scheme can be a screenshot of the syllabus. If that's not possible, give a percentage-based or point-based breakdown of the grading scheme.

* Tips for Success

* Additional Notes
  * Optional if there is nothing of note that needs to be said.
